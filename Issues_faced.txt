1.)Exception : org.hibernate.PersistentObjectException: detached entity passed to persist: com.remindme.restweb.model.StarUser
Reason : See if you you’ve specified that @Id is GENERATED by Hibernate. Do not set an ID before you save/persist it. Hibernate looks at the Entity you’ve passed in and assumes that because it has its PK populated that it is already in the database.
save() and persist() do almost the same things with slightly different semantics . persist() is JPA compliant and save() is a carryover from the original Hibernate. Mainly, save() returns the PK and persist() does not. However, both will generate the PK before the actual SQL INSERT happens (if the PK is generated and not assigned).

2.)Exception : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Update/delete queries cannot be typed
Reason : While calling entityManager.createNamedQuery for an update/delete named query you should not provide the class parameter as it doesn't return an object.
